# nuclearcraft_reactor_optimizer

This program is designed to find the optimal fission reactor design for the minecraft mod Nuclearcraft. You give it the fuel and dimensions of the reactor and it will attempt to find the reactor with the highest RF/t while never melting down. Also, all configurable data, such as cooling stats, can be configured in the code.
